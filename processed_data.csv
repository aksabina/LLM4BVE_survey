For example, in 5.2, the use of the word threshold in ""threshold is weight equals 1 kg."" is a bit weird and not accurate. especially that there is a weird jump between underweight and obese. shouldn't the ""threshold"" be between normal and underweight for example?

Side note: it is very hard to evaluate correctness of the explanation without being biased towards the example itself.","From the examples, I feel like the BMI calculator only accepts integers (rounds the value), so if a baby is 0.4 kg, that becomes 0?
